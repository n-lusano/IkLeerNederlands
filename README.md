Yep, that's me. :point_up:

Hello there! So my name is Nausicaa:sparkles:, and I recently graduated as Junior Full-stack Developer.

This small WIP project is my portfolio, in which I plan to show a bit of what I can do. :grin:

###### _This project is work in progress. Some features still need to be implemented or revised. Any suggestions or feedback is welcome! Feel free to contact me at `n.lusano@gmail.com`_ :v:

### About

Hello there! My name is Nausicaa:sparkles:, and I <s>recently</s> moved to the Netherlands in February 2020, but because of this weird weird year of isolation it feels like _a life ago_ and _yesterday_ at the same time. Weird, huh. :mask: Back in July I also graduated as Junior Full-stack Developer, so maybe that contributed in keeping me distracted and busy while the year slipped away.

This small WIP project is more than a year's worth of notes as a self-taught Dutch learner, because I'm a huge language nerd, and I mean, because why not. :nerd_face:

###### _This project is work in progress. Some features still need to be implemented or revised. Any suggestions or feedback is welcome! Feel free to contact me at `n.lusano@gmail.com`_ :v:
